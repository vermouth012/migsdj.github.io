      <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
      <p>
        When I was a kid, one of my favorite skills was being good at
        traditional <i>Filipino</i> games.<sup>1</sup> I enjoyed playing with my
        friends, whether indoors or outdoors, and I was always eager to join
        in.<sup>2</sup> However, I also had many skills that I was not good at,
        such as <b>creativity</b>.<sup>3</sup> As I grew older and learned more
        about myself, I realized that anyone can improve at anything as long as
        they enjoy it.<sup>4</sup> I started honing my
        <b>drawing skills</b> when I was six years old, and it became something
        I loved to do.<sup>5</sup> When I became a teenager, I noticed that my
        <b>creativity</b>, <b>decision-making</b>, and <b>social skills</b> were
        not as strong as I wanted them to be.<sup>6</sup> I also struggled with
        being indecisive, which made choices difficult for me.<sup>7</sup> Over
        time, I worked on improving my <b>communication skills</b> by talking to
        different people.<sup>8</sup> I was able to practice it by talking to
        random people through <b>online games</b> as well.<sup>9</sup> I also
        practiced <b>decision-making</b> by trying to make choices faster and
        with more confidence.<sup>10</sup> <b>Motivation</b> was another skill I
        developed by pushing myself to achieve small goals every day.<sup
          >11</sup
        >
        I learned the importance of <b>reliability</b> by making sure I kept my
        promises and finished my tasks on time.<sup>12</sup>
        <b>Flexibility</b> became a skill I valued when I had to adapt to
        different situations and unexpected changes.<sup>13</sup> My skills in
        online games also improved as I spent more time playing and learning
        different strategies.<sup>14</sup> In school, I worked on my
        <b>academic skills</b> by studying harder and focusing on subjects that
        challenged me.<sup>15</sup> Being able to balance school, games, and
        personal life was a skill I had to develop over time.<sup>16</sup> I
        also started paying more attention to <b>teamwork</b>, especially in
        group activities and multiplayer games.<sup>17</sup> My ability to stay
        calm under pressure improved as I dealt with tough situations in both
        school and games.<sup>18</sup> <b>Time management</b> became another
        skill I had to improve so I could handle multiple responsibilities.<sup
          >19</sup
        >
        Even though I still have weaknesses, I continue to improve little by
        little every day.<sup>20</sup>
